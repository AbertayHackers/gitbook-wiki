# Formatting and Best Practise

*By [Isaac](../../members/isaac.md)*

There are a few things you'll need to consider when contributing to the Wiki when writing articles, creating new sections, and making general improvements.

This article will go over a few recommendations for formatting and best practise when editing the wiki.

## General Tips

* If you're adding a new section/directory, make sure to add a `README.md` file with the name of the section as the title
* If you're creating a new document or section, add it (and a link to it) in the `SUMMARY.md` file in the root of the wiki
* Don't forget to add a [by-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byline) if you want to be credited for the article
  * If there's already a by-line for an article you're editing, just add your own name on

## Editing using Markdown/Git

* Make sure to adhere to the [markdown guide](../../help-guides/programming-scripting/markdown.md)
* When naming files, try to avoid using spaces and capital letters, this is to avoid any context-sensitivity issues and aid linking to other places in the wiki

## Editing using GitBook
