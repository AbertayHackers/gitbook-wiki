## Projects

### Home Lab

My home lab is composed of an Intel NUC, an old Intel Inspiron business computer I got second hand and a Synology 4-bay NAS. Both computers are running ProxMox and are used for virtualisation. I run services such as a webserver (where my website [www.samiser.xyz](https://web.archive.org/web/20200923101608/http://www.samiser.xyz/) is hosted), gitea, plex, and pfsense. Some stuff I want to get working in future are link aggregation, VLANs and wireless VLANs. For more info or for a good chat, come speak to me or pm me about the current state of the lab.

### Python Discord Bot

A custom Discord bot to manage a music production server. Uses the python Discord API and SQLite for the database of users and posts. Essentially used to let a music rating channel be self-moderated while incentivising quality reviews with XP and discord rewards, like self-promotion.

## Talks

### Immersive Labs w/ Ross

Essentially a talk discussing the features of Immersive Labs, what it's for, why it's useful and why people should be using it. We gave some recommendations for challenges to try for each year. Also touched on other similar platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox etc. The talk was followed by some time for attendees to sign up for Immersive Labs and have a go themselves.

### MMO Hacking on Pwnie Island

A workshop working through the 2015 CTF Pwn Adventure 3, an MMORPG designed to be hacked. The workshop covered reverse engineering a custom network protocol and the game binary, creating a python network proxy to listen, analyse, modify and inject packets, extracting game classes and creating a shared object library to preload and modify the game's behaviour.

### CTFs and Hacking Challenges w/ Ross and Callan

This talk covered some of the solutions from the Tryhackme HackBack CTF event. Also, more generally, went over most basic CTF techniques and approaches to problem solving to encourage newbies to give them a try.
