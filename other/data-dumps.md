#### Equation Group (NSA tools)

A group calling themselves [the shadow brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers) released an encrypted dump of [equation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group) (NSA [TAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations)) exploits and vulnerabilities. These targeted enterprise firewalls, anti-virus products and Microsoft products. They were going to auction the password but eventually just gave away a bunch of them for free. Included was FuzzBunch, the NSA's equivalent of Metasploit, allowing users to “hack into pretty much any Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/VISTA/7/2008/8/2012 computer in the world”

#### Vault 7 (CIA tools)

Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.
