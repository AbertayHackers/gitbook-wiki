## Extensions

### Social Engineering

#### Web Cloner

The Web Cloner extension allows you to take a pixel for pixel clone, as far as is possible[2\)](https://wiki.hacksoc.co.uk/guides/beef#fn__2), of a site and host it yourself. Cloned pages are modified on the fly to automatically hook any user that visits the page as well as intercept any `form` field POST requests.

The post ['BeEF web cloning, BeEF mass mailing, Social Engineering with better BeEF!'](http://blog.beefproject.com/2012/09/beef-web-cloning-beef-mass-mailing.html) has a more detailed intro to the Web Cloner and a getting started using `curl`.
