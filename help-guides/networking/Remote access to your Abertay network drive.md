According to the `Help` section in https://myfiles.abertay.ac.uk/myfiles/. In fact this whole guide wouldn't have happened without it, but that's the only part I'm including without personal testing

If your Desktop Environment is Unity, Gnome, XFCE or LXDE, that's what you want. It actually depends on whether your distro uses GVFS or KIO for it's virtual folder access

Warning: KNetAttach(the script for connecting to webdav folders in KDE Plasma) is currently broken. You can still connect to the network drive by putting `webdavs://myfiles.abertay.ac.uk/myfiles/hcwebdav/Home drive/` into the full path in Dolphin
