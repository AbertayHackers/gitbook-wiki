## Key Types

Key types are listed in the order of preference below:

1. `ED25519`
2. \>= 2048bit `RSA`

**Never** use `DSA` keys and avoid `ECDSA` keys if you can. Both [fail catastrophically on bad randomness](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5096/rsa-vs-dsa-for-ssh-authentication-keys/46781#46781).

## Mobile

If you use SSH on the go often you'll want to look at using [Mosh](https://mosh.org/)

### iOS

- [Termius](https://www.termius.com/) [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/termius-ssh-shell-console-terminal/id549039908?mt=8) (free)
- [Prompt 2](https://panic.com/prompt/) [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/prompt-2/id917437289?mt=8) (£14.99)

## Examples

### Generate Keys

The `ssh-keygen` utility is used to create new SSH keys on most *nix systems.

#### ED25519

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100
```

- `-t`: Type of key to generate
- `-a`: Number of Key Derivation Function (KDF) rounds

#### RSA

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -a 100
```

- `-t`: Type of key to generate
- `-b`: Size of key in bits
- `-a`: Number of (KDF) rounds

### Remove Hashed known_hosts Entry

If your client is set to hash known hosts e.g. has the following line in `~/.ssh/config`

```
HashKnownHosts yes
```

Then your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file will be obfuscated.

To remove a host, when its hosts key changes, you'll need to execute:

```
ssh-keygen -R example.com
```

Which will remove all keys associated with that hostname from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

## Configuration

### Client

#### Permissions

```
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_*
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
```

Only allow your user to access `~/.ssh` and your private keys, allow group and world to access your public keys.

#### config

Client configuration file, only lists no default settings.

- config

  `# ~/.shh/config # ssh_config(5) Host * # For all hosts use the following directives     Protocol 2    # Use only protocol version two        IdentitiesOnly yes    # By default ssh will send all public keys (identities) in ~/.ssh to the server if you don't specify which key to use with -i    # This prevents that by only using the public keys explicitly configured in config or specified with -i          VisualHostKey yes    # Print an ASCII art representation of the remote host key fingerprint at login and for unknown host keys        HashKnownHosts yes    # Hash host names and addresses when they are added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.    # ssh-keygen -R hostname    # Removes all keys belonging to hostname from a known_hosts file.

### Server

#### Permissions

```
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
```

Only allow your user to access `~/.ssh` and `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. **These permissions are required** by the `StrictModes` directive.

#### sshd_config

Server configuration file, only lists none default settings.
