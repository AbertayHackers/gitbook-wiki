# Remote access to your Abertay network drive

So, you've forgotten your [pendrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pendrive) enough times and been left wondering where did that question 14 you *surely* did get lost?

I doesn't have to be like that! You can copy files from the home machine to university account with ease, and this guide will show you how. All you need is your university number, the password and a computer with [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) access. There are three ways to go about it.

According to the `Help` section in https://myfiles.abertay.ac.uk/myfiles/. In fact this whole guide wouldn't have happened without it, but that's the only part I'm including without personal testing

If your Desktop Environment is Unity, Gnome, XFCE or LXDE, that's what you want. It actually depends on whether your distro uses GVFS or KIO for it's virtual folder access

If your DE is KDE Plasma or LXQT, that's what you want

Warning: KNetAttach(the script for connecting to webdav folders in KDE Plasma) is currently broken. You can still connect to the network drive by putting `webdavs://myfiles.abertay.ac.uk/myfiles/hcwebdav/Home drive/` into the full path in Dolphin
