### PEP 8

PEP 8 is the coding style adhered to by python developers for the python binaries and standard library code. You can read the guide in its [entirety](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), or as a [helpful summary](https://robinwinslow.uk/2014/01/05/summary-of-python-code-style-conventions/) with examples.

Main Highlights
- [4 spaces](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces) per [indentation level](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation)

The [autopep8](https://github.com/pbrod/autopep8) package "automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide".
